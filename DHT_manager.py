''' This python file acts as the DHT manager for the CSE 434 Socket Project. 
    It is responsible for handling the DHT and communication between the peers.

    The port numbers available to use are 42000-42499. The DHT manager will use port 42000.

    The requirements for the full project are as follows:
    For the full project deadline, you are to implement the all commands to the manager listed in ยง1.1. 
    This also involves implementation of all commands issued between peers that are associated with these commands as described in ยง1.2.
